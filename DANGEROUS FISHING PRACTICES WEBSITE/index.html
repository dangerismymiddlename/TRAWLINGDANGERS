<p class="p1"> Bottom trawling includes the towing of nets of all sizes along the ocean floor.
  This is typically done for commercial purposes. This fishing practice is proven
  extremely destructive and dangerous to marine ecosystems and their biodiversity.
  Bottom trawling causes changes to the environment by wiping out entire deep underwater
  ecosystems that act as underwater rainforests. The main two parts of the environment that are
  affected by trawling are coral reefs and maerl beds. </p>

<P class="p2"> 90% of coral colonies perish, and up to two-thirds of sponges are damaged.
    Entire colonies are wiped out. Sometimes colonies of corals carbon dated to 4,000 years old have been destroyed
        and swept up by these nets. Fish and organisms of all kinds are picked up.</p>

<p class="p4">As the net drags along the seafloor, all creatures in its path—fish, animals,
    marine mammals, plants, and turtles—are scooped up along the way. The fishing
    vessel keeps the targeted commercial species and discards the remaining, unwanted
    fish and animals—virtually all of it dead or dying. “Much more biomass of fish and
    habitat-forming species has been removed from the deep-sea than we thought. This has
    altered the ecosystem in ways that we have yet to understand,” Palomares said.
    The chart to the left shows that the trawling
    footprint was as high as 80 percent in the Adriatic Sea, part of the Mediterranean.
     All of these areas are trawled annually meaning once a year. Where the red is shown is where they trawl
     which covers a huge area. All red areas also knowed less life on the sea floor.
     Since these areas are trawled repeatedly, there is little to no room for growth in the ecosystem.  </p>
